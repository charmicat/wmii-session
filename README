where you like, and adjust the source commands in those files.

and you may copy *.desktop to $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications

if you like to use vimprobable2 or zathura you have to apply the patches


## CONFIGURATION

at the top of session.sh you can set some variables

in your shell rc:

alias vim='vim --servername "$(wmiir cat /tag/sel/ctl | sed '1q')"'

if you use the sample wmiirc_local, 
you can set the mime types to use the events by default:

xdg-mime default openurl.desktop application/xhtml_xml
xdg-mime default openurl.desktop text/html
xdg-mime default openurl.desktop text/xml
xdg-mime default openpdf.desktop application/pdf


## USAGE

run wmii-session wmii-browser and wmii-pdf
or try the sample wmiirc_local
and use openurl and openpdf to use the events

you can save a session template named foo and foo.bar
now when you open a task in project foo.bar.baz with no saved session
the session template foo.bar will be loaded. If you open a task
in the project foo.baz.blah the template foo will be loaded
